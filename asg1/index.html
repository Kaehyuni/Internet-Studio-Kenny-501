      <p>
        I want my semester project to focus on transforming education from a 2D experience into a 3D one. Many of us spend most of our time learning on a screen, but staring at a flat image makes it difficult to fully explore or interact with concepts in a hands-on way. Without real-time interaction, students often struggle to truly understand the material.

      <p>
        As a science academic coach and tutor at Dallas College Richland Learning Commons, I see how easily students can get lost when trying to interpret a diagram in a textbook or an image online. To address this, I want to create a website where students can use their phone cameras to scan a QR code and access interactive learning tools. These would include videos of 3D models or animations that demonstrate how different parts of biology work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site would also serve as a resource hub, providing students with additional materials and videos to support their learning. As a student myself, I understand how challenging it can be to stay focused and grasp complex concepts without engaging, interactive methods. My goal is to build a platform that makes learning more visual, hands-on, and effective.
