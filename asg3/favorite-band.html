<!-- Why they are my favorite -->
<p>
Stray Kids are my favorite band because their music is powerful and inspiring. Their songs motivate me to keep going even when life feels tough. I also admire how the members write and produce their own music, showing their dedication and creativity. I managed to go to their concert this summer. I had a blast and their energy was unmatched like anything I saw before. They left a great impression on me.
