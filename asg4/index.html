  <h2>Why is he my least favorite</h2>
  <p>
    Jung Joon-young is my least favorite celebrity because his career was overshadowed by scandals 
    that destroyed public trust and respect for his work in music and television.
  </p>

  <h2>What he did</h2>
  <p>
    He was caught filming women without their consent and sharing the videos in group chats. 
    These crimes shocked the nation and severely harmed victims.
  </p>

  <h2>His imprisonment</h2>
  <p>
    In 2019, he was sentenced to prison for sexual crimes related to the hidden camera cases. 
    His sentence was reduced from six years to five years, and his entertainment career ended.
  </p>

  <h2>Three artists I prefer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>T.O.P (BIGBANG)</li>
    <li>Andy (Shinhwa)</li>
    <li>Kim Hyun-joong</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Top worst works</h2>
