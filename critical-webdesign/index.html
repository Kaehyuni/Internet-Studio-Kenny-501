  <h1>Assignment Questions</h1>

  <h2>Denise Jacobs and the Inner Critic</h2>
  <p>
    Denise Jacobs explains that everyone has a troll-like inner critic that blocks creativity. 
    The method that would help me the most is “switch it up,” where I challenge the truth of what the critic is saying 
    and remind myself that comparisons are meaningless. This works for me because it forces me to stop believing negative thoughts 
    and focus on the fact that I have my own strengths and style.

  <h2>David McRaney and Hyperbolic Discounting</h2>
  <p>
    David McRaney describes hyperbolic discounting as our tendency to choose smaller rewards now instead of waiting for larger rewards later. 
    One method he suggests is to make the future reward feel more real by visualizing it or connecting it to something personal. 
    The method that would work best for me is to break big goals into smaller steps so I can see progress and stay motivated to wait for the bigger reward.

  <h2>Critical Web Design and Network Power</h2>
  <p>
    Critical Web Design describes four types of power in networks. 
    As a beginner in web publishing I have the power to create and share my own content, 
    but I do not have the same wide influence as big media companies or platforms. 
    Still, I have the power of participation and the ability to connect with others through my work online.
