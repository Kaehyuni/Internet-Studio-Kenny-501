        Hassan and I started by reviewing what I have already built for my project, which is a website designed to help students who struggle with traditional, text-heavy science learning. The site has three pages: a homepage introducing my goal and background, a QR Code page that lets users access a 3D model through augmented reality on their phones, and a resource page linking to educational videos and explanations. We discussed what information I currently have, which includes my concept, website structure, and the goal of creating a 3D model. What is missing, however, is testing how the QR code works across different devices and finding data about how students interact with AR in education. Hassan suggested that I gather statistics about how AR impacts student comprehension in science to strengthen the factual foundation of the project.

      <p>
        Emotionally, I told Hassan that I feel very passionate and hopeful about this project because it comes from my own experience as a science tutor. I shared how I have seen many students become frustrated reading long digital textbooks, which inspired me to make something more engaging. Hassan said he could sense my personal connection and found that emotion powerful because it gives the project heart. However, he also noted that I might feel nervous about the technical complexity of building AR features, which is normal. We both agreed that the excitement outweighs the fear because of the positive emotional impact it could have on students who feel left behind by traditional learning.

        In this part, we discussed potential problems. Hassan pointed out that not all students have iPhones or devices that can handle AR content. Accessibility and device compatibility could limit participation. We also talked about the possibility of technical bugs or issues scanning the QR code. I added that hosting 3D models online may require extra storage and load time. From a tutor’s perspective, I also need to ensure the AR models are scientifically accurate. Hassan emphasized being cautious about overpromising what the AR feature can do during the early development stage.

        Despite the challenges, Hassan and I focused on the opportunities. He said the project has huge potential to transform how students engage with science, especially visual learners. We imagined college and high school students interacting with molecules, cells, or chemical reactions right on their desks. I shared how this could make tutoring sessions more immersive and motivate students to explore topics on their own. We also noted that the project’s positive educational impact could attract partnerships with schools or educational programs that want to integrate AR learning.

      <p>
        During this part, Hassan helped me brainstorm ways to expand the idea. He suggested that in the future, I could include short AR lessons where students tap on parts of a 3D model to read short fun facts or watch animations. We also discussed adding a Student Gallery section where users could upload their AR screenshots or reflections. I thought about integrating multilingual support for international students since science is a universal subject. This creative brainstorming helped us see that the website can evolve far beyond just an AR display. It can become an interactive learning ecosystem.

      <p>
        In our final reflection, we reviewed how our discussion flowed and summarized the next steps. The main goals moving forward are to research AR compatibility across devices, test QR code functionality, and refine the layout of each webpage for smoother navigation. Hassan suggested setting a timeline by first finalizing the design of the homepage and resource pages, then focusing on the AR content. I agreed that having a structured plan will help me stay organized and realistic. This step also helped me think about how to evaluate the project’s success by seeing how students respond to it during tutoring sessions.

        How My Project Changed After the Discussion
      </h2>
      <p>
        After talking with Hassan, my project direction became much clearer and more balanced. Before, I was mainly focused on making the AR model work, but now I see the importance of accessibility, testing, and user experience. I plan to research AR educational effectiveness and ensure the site works on multiple platforms, not just iPhones. I will also consider adding small creative features like interactive facts and a student gallery to make the learning process even more fun. This discussion reminded me that a strong educational tool does not just look cool. It needs to be practical, inclusive, and emotionally engaging.
