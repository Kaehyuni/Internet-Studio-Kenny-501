      <h2 id="intro-title">What My Ideal Freelance Job Looks Like</h2>
      <p>
        My ideal job is a freelancing career where I can combine visual design, animation, and sound. I want to work on projects that let me create graphics, motion, and audio that feel connected. Freelancing is appealing because I can build a flexible schedule around school and other responsibilities. I like the idea of choosing clients that fit my style and values. I also want to keep learning different tools and workflows as media technology changes. Over time, I hope my freelance work will grow into a steady career with long term clients. I see freelancing as a way to share my creativity and build a portfolio that shows who I am as a creator.

          <p class="job-description">
            This job is a strong match for me because I enjoy working with live sound and audiences.
            I like the idea that about sixty percent of my time at an event would focus on mixing and careful listening.
            Around twenty percent of my time would go into setting up speakers, microphones, and cables in a clean way.
            The last twenty percent would be communication with artists and quick problem solving during shows.
            I study audio and recording engineering, so I can bring knowledge of gain staging, equalization, and dynamics into each performance.
            The pay per event gives me a clear way to plan my freelance income while I am in school.
            I think this role would help me grow as a professional engineer and build a reliable network in the Dallas music scene.

      <h2 id="freelance-title">Thinking About Freelancing and Percentages</h2>
      <p>
        Freelancing requires careful thinking about how my time divides into different percentages.
        I might aim for about sixty to seventy percent of my week to be billable work.
        Around twenty percent might go to learning new tools, practicing skills, and updating my portfolio.
        The remaining ten to twenty percent would be used for answering emails, sending invoices, and searching for new projects.
        I also need to think about how my income splits into taxes, savings, and regular expenses.
        A part of my earnings would pay for software, equipment, and training that keeps my work at a high quality.
        Understanding these percentages can help me design a freelance career that supports both my finances and my health.
