      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Traditional education tools often keep students stuck with flat two dimensional representations of complex subjects. As a biology tutor, I see that diagrams of cells and processes like cellular respiration confuse students rather than helping them. It is hard for them to understand how these systems actually move and work when everything is flattened onto a page or a screen. This project will solve that problem by creating three dimensional interactive models that make learning easier to see and understand.</p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The main audience is high school and college students who are studying biology and other science subjects. These students grew up using technology and are very familiar with screens, but they often lose interest when learning tools are too static or boring. They respond better to interactive, visual, and hands on experiences that help them feel connected to the subject matter.</p>

      <h2>Competition</h2>
      <p>Other educational resources include textbooks, online videos, and static diagrams. While these are helpful, they often cannot fully explain or show movement in biological processes. Competitors like Khan Academy or YouTube tutorials provide strong explanations, but they still remain limited to two dimensional images or animations that do not allow real interaction. This project will provide something new by letting students actually explore and interact with three dimensional models in real time.</p>

      <h2>Key Messages</h2>
      <p>Learning biology can be exciting, interactive, and easy to understand. Students will not only hear about a process but will see it happen in front of them. Education should not just tell information, it should show it clearly. This project will deliver that message by using three dimensional models that bring science to life.</p>

      <h2>Call to Action</h2>
      <p>Students should use the models to explore biology and interact with the processes as if they were inside the cell. They will be able to move around, zoom in, and experience how everything works. This approach invites students to learn through doing and seeing, instead of just memorizing facts from a page.</p>

      <h2>How to Measure Success</h2>
      <p>Success will be measured by how much students understand and how engaged they are when using the models. If students can explain processes more clearly and with confidence, then the project will be successful. Feedback will be collected from students and tutors to see if the three dimensional models improved comprehension. Tracking how long students interact with the models and what they remember later will also help measure results.</p>
